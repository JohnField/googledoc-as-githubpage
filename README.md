# googledoc-as-githubpage

Embed a Google Doc in a [GitHub Page](https://pages.github.com/).

Initially implemented as an MVP for [http://walthamstow.me/](http://walthamstow.me/) - see [https://medium.com/@Vodex/walthamstow-me-d745f2bd4ea4](https://medium.com/@Vodex/walthamstow-me-d745f2bd4ea4)

It seems best practice is to publish the gDoc, then embed it in a page along with non-gDoc assets like Google Analytics scripts.

I've used [google-docs-publisher](https://github.com/aug-riedinger/google-docs-publisher) for this, and in turn wrapped in GitHub Pages using Jekyll.

And adapted [github-fork-ribbon-css](https://github.com/simonwhitaker/github-fork-ribbon-css) as a callout to encourage contributions to the gDoc.
