# googledoc-as-githubpage

Embed a Google Doc in a GitHub Page.

Initially implemented in http://walthamstow.me/ as an MVP - see https://medium.com/@Vodex/walthamstow-me-d745f2bd4ea4 

The recommended Google Analytics practice is to publish the gDoc, then embed it in a page with tracking scripts.

This in turn is then hosted as a GitHub page.

# Configuration

See _config.yml for configuration of the code and Google Doc URL.
