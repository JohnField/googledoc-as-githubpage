# googledoc-as-githubpage

Embed a Google Doc in a GitHub Page.

Initially implemented in http://walthamstow.me/ as an MVP website.

The recommended Google Analytics practice is to embed the gDoc in a page, and put tracking code (and I suppose other HTML goodies) in the page.
So, this is a simple wrapper implemented as a GitHub page.
